# This Is Second try of Assigment 1 !

### About 
This is assigment 1 of STIW3054 (Real Time Programming ) A182 Universiti Utara Malaysia , 
which is about implementation of   Estimating Software based on 
Use case points (Carrol , 2005) into real calculation

it is well known that estimating the resource need it for developing a software regardless it is complex or simple is difficult , most software engineers estimate the project resources by using their feeling for their base estimate. In his article (Carrol ,2005) describes how the Agilis Solution and FPT Software Engineering teams create accurate estimation process with the Use Case Points as their basis .
